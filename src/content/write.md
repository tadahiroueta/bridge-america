mm/dd/yyyy
# <title>

This is markdown, a special text file type that lets you add styling through text alone. For example, to italicise text simply use ‘*’ around your text (*example*) or use ‘#’ to make headers like this:

### <header>

Don’t worry too much about this whole markdown stuff; just write clearly and concisely. This website was made to make information easily accessible, not to earn you a good English grade.

One last thing: make sure to edit the placeholders at the top of this file so properly displays the name, date, title... 

Thanks for help, by the way. You’re amazing.

Love,
